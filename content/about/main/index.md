  I've worked at the bench, analyzed and visualized data for publication, created and disseminated technical training materials, and developed data sharing platforms, R packages, and data visualization tools for the biomedical research community. 
  
  While it's been a meandering path, I've found that I love tackling new problems, thinking about complex systems, and delivering open-source resources and tooling that aid the research community.
  
  Outside of the technical minutiae, I am a proud af queer person, dog dad, and amateur houseplant enthusiast located in Seattle, WA. 
  
  Take a look around and don't be afraid to let me know what you think! I'm always happy to connect with other folks in the field.
